# Fish-Recognition-Clustering

This is a project I made for a Data Science Workshop during my BSc in the Open University of Israel.
This is also an ongoing project as it is meant to provide a solution to a real lab in Tel Aviv University.
The colab notebook summarize the work done during the workshop period, it is recommended to open it with colab as it include some feature that will work only in that env.
